# What is Eventify?

[Eventify](https://eventify.it) is a simple event management SaaS app. It allows you to accept registrations and payments, keep track of the subscribed users and control the event financial situation in real-time, without using a single spreadsheet.

The main value of Eventify is the time and the annoyance it allows you to save. This way you can spend more time promoting your event or improving its quality for a greater success.
