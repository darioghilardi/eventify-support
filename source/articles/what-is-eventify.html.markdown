# What is Eventify?

[Eventify](https://eventify.it) is a simple event management SaaS app. It allows you to accept registrations and payments, keep track of the subscribed users and control the event financial situation in real-time, without using a single spreadsheet.

Since you get a ready-to-use subscription and reports system, you save a ton of time while keeping everything under control. This helps you focus on other more business relevant activities. For example, increasing the event quality, promoting the event, organizing new events!

[Eventify](https://eventify.it) is created by event organisers for event organisers. But it's so simple that you can use it even if this is the first event you create in your life.
